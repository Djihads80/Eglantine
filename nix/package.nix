  # Eglantine's dependency list. Written out rather than inherited from
  # pkgs.eden: that made this package's dependencies another emulator's
  # decision (Eden links SDL2 where this tree is SDL3-only, fmt_11 where
  # cpmfile.json asks for 12.1.0), made it fail outright if nixpkgs ever
  # renamed `eden`, and cannot be submitted to nixpkgs, where a derivation
  # cannot inherit from a sibling one.
  #
  # Policy: nixpkgs first. cpmfile.json stays the pin, but a dependency that
  # nixpkgs can serve is taken from nixpkgs instead of being compiled from
  # source here -- it arrives from the binary cache and its build recipe is
  # maintained upstream. Only what nixpkgs cannot serve is built from the
  # manifest, which is what the -D<package>_FORCE_SYSTEM flags below select.
  #
  # Listed here because CPM cannot serve them:
  #   ffmpeg-headless  deliberately the system build, see the FFmpeg note below
  #   openssl          upstream's Linux build links the system OpenSSL too
  #   gamemode         Linux only, loaded by the running process rather than
  #                    linked; upstream installs the distro's dev package
  #   qt6.qtbase       Core, Gui, Widgets and Concurrent all live here
  #   qt6.qtcharts     listed in YUZU_QT_COMPONENTS, so required unconditionally
  #   qt6.qtwayland    the wayland platform plugin the wrapper hook needs
  #
  # Removed from the inherited Eden list because nothing here uses them:
  #   SDL2, stb (vendored in externals/stb, which defines the target),
